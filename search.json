    "text": "Technically my first name is Qi, and my family name is Lee. I grew up as a Chinese Singaporean. In Chinese culture, family names typically come before your own name. Whereas in Singaporean culture, Chinese names are often two syllable names, rather than just one. As such I grew up being referred to as Lee Qi, instead of just Qi. Using Qi alone is more like a dimunitive nickname that my family and some childhood friends use."
