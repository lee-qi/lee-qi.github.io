### My Name
Technically my first name is Qi, and my family name is Lee. I grew up as a Chinese Singaporean. In Chinese culture, family names typically come before your own name. Whereas in Singaporean culture, Chinese names are often two syllable names, rather than just one. As such I grew up being referred to as Lee Qi, instead of just Qi. Using Qi alone is more like a dimunitive nickname that my family and some childhood friends use.

## My Education
I graduated with an International Baccalaureate diploma from the Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific. Thereafter, I received a BSc from the University of Miami, and an MSc from the University of Washington's School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences. Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Washington's School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences, co-supervised by Drs. Andr√© Punt and Ray Hilborn.

## My Research
My research focuses on ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management- looking at factors influencing fishing behaviour and management strategies for fisheries with limited data and/or capacity for management. I also make the occasional foray into stock assessment, and I work with and mentor fisheries scientists around the world.

## My Life
In my spare time, I enjoy playing with my foster dog (former foster #4 Bowie pictured here), working on my bicycle, and figuring out what went wrong with my sourdough.
